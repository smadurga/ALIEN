Diffusion, encapsulation and release of topical Active agents in oLIgoEthyleNglycol micro/nanogels


ALIEN aims to design computational strategies for encapsulation and controlled release of topical compounds in OEG-micro/nanogels. 

The specific objectives of the ALIEN research project are:

1. To develop a computational methodology for predicting the structural properties of different OEG-micro/nanogels characterized experimentally, including thermodynamics and kinetics of the swollen/collapse transition. The methodology will also predict the effect of conditions such as pH, temperature, and bulk salt ions on the physicochemical properties of OEG-micro/nanogels.

2. To design a computational methodology for simulating and predicting the diffusion, encapsulation, and release of hydrophobic/hydrophilic solutes measured experimentally in different OEG-micro/nanogels dispersed in a homogeneous medium. The methodology will also determine the relevant interactions (electrostatic and/or hydrophobic) between solutes and OEG-micro/nanogels required to reproduce experimental trends and identify the main factors that influence the encapsulation capacity of OEG-micro/nanogels and the release profile of active solutes.

3. To develop a computational methodology for simulating and predicting the structural properties of micro/nanogels and the release of active molecules of hydrophobic/hydrophilic solutes measured experimentally in OEG-micro/nanogels at liquid-fluid interfaces. The methodology will also correlate surface activity with changes in morphology obtained by DPD simulations and study the effect of the interface on the encapsulation ability and release.
